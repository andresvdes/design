            <p>Hi there and welcome! My name is Andres and I’m a visual designer with eight years of experience making digital products and services. I’ve a background working with organizations in the communication, media, and software development fields, from scrappy startups, non-profits, to established large companies. Nowadays I’m passionate about exploring visual styles and am a budding UI animator, web and brand designer. I’m committed to connecting my clients with their desired aesthetic and develop their brand.</p>

        <p>I have strong interests in education, altruism, economic empowerment and ecological stewardship. I get excited about projects that allow me to solve design problems while maintaining a focus on ethics, diversity and inclusion. I’m always teaching myself any skill necessary to bring ideas to fruition and I’m not afraid to explore and fail. From a young age I was always attracted to the intersection of technology and the arts. I’ve been creating, drawing and writing in some shape or form since grade school but recently reignited my passion for digital design. I also developed a love for dance, partner and solo, through cuban salsa, urban/funk, and afro beats which led me to create and perform dance choreographies in the bay area.</p>
